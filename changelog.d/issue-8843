synopsis: cabal haddock-project by default creates self contained
          documentation (formerly it required `--local` switch).
          
          `--gen-contents`, `--gen-index`, `--quickjump` and
          `--hyperlinked-source` options where removed as they are always
          passed to haddock.

          The same PR aslo fixes a bug which allows to use `haddock-project`
          with packages which contain sublibraries.
packages: cabal-install
